Learn to test-drive a single-class program.

## Introduction

Test-driving a single-class program is similar to test-driving a single-method
program. Our approach differs purely because methods and classes are different.

**A method** is a reusable chunk of code that takes input as arguments and
returns a value.

**An object** is a structure that wraps ('encapsulates') a collection of values
(called 'state' or 'memory') and exposes some methods that can operate on that
state.

**A class** is a blueprint for creating objects.

**In object-oriented programming, the most important unit of behaviour is the
class.** We build our programs by creating classes that work together to
accomplish the job of the program.

To introduce this, we're going to:

1. Test-drive a single-class program.
2. Design a single-class program.
3. Test-drive a system of classes.
4. Design a system of classes.

In this step, we will test-drive a single-class program. This means we will
focus on the 'Create Examples as Tests' and 'Implement Behaviour' steps first.

## Creating Examples for Single-Class Programs

Instead of an example like this:

```python
extract_uppercase("hello WORLD") => ["WORLD"]
```

We will need to create examples of the behaviour of the class, like this:

```python
# When an order is created with an address
# The address is reflected in the address attribute
order = Order("123 Fake Street")
assert order.address == "123 Fake Street"

# When we add two valid items to the order
# And we format the order note
# It returns a string with the address and the items
order = Order("123 Fake Street")
order.add_item("Chair")
order.add_item("Moisturiser")
assert order.format_note() == "Order for 123 Fake Street: Chair, Moisturiser"
```

Some methods on a class can be tested individually, but much of the time
creating examples for a class requires multiple methods to be called.

Implementing behaviour is roughly the same as for methods, though we will place
more emphasis on building the examples and behaviour in small steps due to the
increased complexity of single-class tests.

## Exercise

Test-drive a class with the following interface. Feel free to re-use your
previous code, or re-write it if you want to practice.

```python
class DiaryEntry:
    def __init__(self, title, contents):
        # Parameters:
        #   title: string
        #   contents: string
        pass

    def format(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A formatted diary entry, for example:
        #   "My Title: These are the contents"
        pass

    def count_words(self):
        # Returns:
        #   int: the number of words in the diary entry
        pass

    def reading_time(self, wpm):
        # Parameters:
        #   wpm: an integer representing the number of words the user can read 
        #        per minute
        # Returns:
        #   int: an estimate of the reading time in minutes for the contents at
        #        the given wpm.
        pass

    def reading_chunk(self, wpm, minutes):
        # Parameters
        #   wpm: an integer representing the number of words the user can read
        #        per minute
        #   minutes: an integer representing the number of minutes the user has
        #            to read
        # Returns:
        #   string: a chunk of the contents that the user could read in the
        #           given number of minutes
        #
        # If called again, `reading_chunk` should return the next chunk,
        # skipping what has already been read, until the contents is fully read.
        # The next call after that should restart from the beginning.
        pass
```

## Challenge

Test-drive a class with the following interface. Feel free to re-use or re-write
your previous code.

```python
class GrammarStats:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
  
    def check(self, text):
        # Parameters:
        #   text: string
        # Returns:
        #   bool: true if the text begins with a capital letter and ends with a
        #         sentence-ending punctuation mark, false otherwise
        pass
  
    def percentage_good(self):
        # Returns:
        #   int: the percentage of texts checked so far that passed the check
        #        defined in the `check` method. The number 55 represents 55%.
        pass
```
