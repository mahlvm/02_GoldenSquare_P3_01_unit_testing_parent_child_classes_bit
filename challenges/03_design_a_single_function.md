# Design a Single-Function Program

_**This is a Makers Vine.** Vines are designed to gradually build up
sophisticated skills. They contain a mixture of text and video, and may contain
some challenge exercises without proposed solutions. [Read more about how to use

Learn to design a single-function program.

## On Design

In the last exercise, you were given a design for a function, wrote some tests,
and then implemented the behaviour to make those tests pass.

However, in industry an engineer will rarely be given a design. They will
instead be given a problem to solve. They will then have to decide how to design
their program to solve the problem.

To support you in growing towards this, we will use the idea of **Design
Recipes**. You might use different design recipes for different kinds of
program. We will start off with a simple one for a single-function program.

Here is a template for you to use. Steps 1 and 2 are new, and steps 3 and 4 are
what you did in the last exercise.

> # Single-Function Programs Design Recipe
> 
> ## 1. Describe the Problem
> 
> Typically you will be given a short statement that does this called a user
> story. In industry, you may also need to ask further questions to clarify
> aspects of the problem.
> 
> ## 2. Design the Function Signature
> 
> The signature of a function includes:
> 
> * The name of the function.
> * What parameters it takes, their names and data types.
> * What it returns and the data type of that value.
> * Any other side effects it might have.
> 
> Steps 3 and 4 then operate as a cycle.
> 
> ## 3. Create Examples as Tests
> 
> These are examples of the function being called with particular arguments, and
> what the function should return in each situation.
> 
> For complex challenges you might want to come up with a list of examples first
> and then test-drive them one by one. For simpler ones you might just dive
> straight into writing a test for the first example you want to address.
> 
> ## 4. Implement the Behaviour
> 
> For each example you create as a test, implement the behaviour that allows the
> function to return the right value for the given arguments.
> 
> Then return to step 3 until you have addressed the problem you were given. You
> may also need to revise your design, for example if you realise you made a
> mistake earlier.

## Exercises

Follow the design recipe to implement the following user stories in your
project. User stories follow a specific format — don't worry about that too much
now, you'll get the hang of it.

### One

> As a user  
> So that I can manage my time  
> I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read
> 200 words a minute.

[Example solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPC2JICqodQ&t=0s)

### Two

> As a user  
> So that I can improve my grammar  
> I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a
> suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark.

[Example solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPC2JICqodQ&t=722s)

## Challenge

**This is a process feedback challenge.** That means you should record yourself
doing it and submit that recording to your coach for feedback. [How do I do
this?](../pills/process_feedback_challenges.md)

Follow the design recipe to implement the following user story in your project:

> As a user  
> So that I can keep track of my tasks  
> I want to check if a text includes the string `#TODO`.

After you're done, [submit your recording
