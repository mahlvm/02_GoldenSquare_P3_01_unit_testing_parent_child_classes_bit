# Create Your Project

In this series of challenges you will build a project in a series of steps.

Before we get started, you'll need to set up a new python project. Feel free to
create new projects whenever you like to organise your work across these
challenges.

This project will use a few components:

* **Python**  
  The programming language.

* **Pip**  
  A tool for managing dependencies in a Python project. A dependency is a piece of
  software someone else has written to help others build programs. In Python these
  dependencies are known as 'libaries', you will recognise them from local, in-built libraries we have used such as `random` and `math`.

* **Pytest**  
  A test framework for use with Python. A test framework is a tool for writing and
  running tests.

* **Git**  
  A version control system for use with any programming language. In the
  industry software projects are changed by many people in small steps, and
  version control systems help us keep track of those changes.

[To set up your project follow this guide.](../pills/setting_up_a_pytest_project.md) 

Then move on to the next step.
