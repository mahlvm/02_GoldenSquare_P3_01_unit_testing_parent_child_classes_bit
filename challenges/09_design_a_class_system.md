# Design a Multi-Class Program

_**This is a Makers Vine.** Vines are designed to gradually build up sophisticated skills. They contain a mixture of text and video, and may contain some challenge exercises without proposed solutions. [Read more about how to use Makers

Learn to design a multi-class program.

## Introduction

Once more we need to update our design recipe. However, this time we have a
whole new level of challenge. How do we figure out how to break our program up
into classes? There are two common approaches to this:

1. **Emergent Design**  
   Start with a single class, and then extract out new classes when it seems
   like it is doing too much.

2. **Planned Design**  
   Design a multi-class system and then build it, updating your design as you
   learn where you were wrong at first.

You can also use a mix of both.

We are going to start off with Planned Design. Exercises on Emergent Design are
available in the adventure section — and you're not too far!

Here's our Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

> # Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe
> 
> ## 1. Describe the Problem
> 
> Typically you will be given a short statement that does this called a user
> story. In industry, you may also need to ask further questions to clarify
> aspects of the problem.
> 
> ## 2. Design the Class System
> 
> Design the interfaces of each of your classes and how they will work together
> to achieve the job of the program. You can use diagrams to visualise the
> relationships between classes.
> 
> Consider pulling out the key verbs and nouns in the problem description to
> help you figure out which classes and methods to have.
> 
> Steps 3, 4, and 5 then operate as a cycle.
> 
> ## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests
> 
> Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations
> and combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used.
> 
> Encode one of these as a test and move to step 4.
> 
> ## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests
> 
> Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
> a more granular level of detail.
> 
> Encode one of these as a test and move to step 5.
> 
> ## 5. Implement the Behaviour
> 
> For each example you create as a test, implement the behaviour that allows the
> class to behave according to your example.
> 
> Then return to step 3 until you have addressed the problem you were given. You
> may also need to revise your design, for example if you realise you made a
> mistake earlier.

## Exercise

This is the big one! You might want to start a new pytest project for this.

Use object-oriented design and test-driven development, backed up by your
debugging and pairing skills, to develop the following program.

> As a user  
> So that I can record my experiences  
> I want to keep a regular diary

> As a user  
> So that I can reflect on my experiences  
> I want to read my past diary entries 

> As a user  
> So that I can reflect on my experiences in my busy day  
> I want to select diary entries to read based on how much time I have and my
> reading speed

> As a user  
> So that I can keep track of my tasks  
> I want to keep a todo list along with my diary

> As a user  
> So that I can keep track of my contacts  
> I want to see a list of all of the mobile phone numbers in all my diary
> entries

Some pointers:

* Remember that user stories don't map to classes 1:1. You'll need to digest the
  full problem and then develop a multi-class system that meets the user's
  needs.
* Don't worry about user interface or input-output. That means you shouldn't be
  using `input()` and only use `print()` for debugging purposes.

## Example Solution

There are many ways to solve this exercise, but [here is an example
solution.](https://youtu.be/QzdvNpqTUKY&t=0s) Bear in mind that once you look at it,
you may be influenced by my approach and this may affect how much learning you
can get from this exercise. That said, I trust you to make the right decision.

## Moving On

You've now completed all of the core challenges for this module.
