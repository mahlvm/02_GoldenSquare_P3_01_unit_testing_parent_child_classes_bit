# Process Feedback Challenges

Some of the challenges in this module are process feedback challenges. This
means you will record yourself doing them and then share the recording with your
coach. They will then give you some feedback on your engineering practices.

## How do I do this?

The easiest way to do this is using Zoom.

1. **Open up a Zoom call.**  
   If it's just you then it'll be just you on the call, which is fine. [What if
   I'm pairing?](#what-if-im-pairing)

2. **Share your screen.**  
   Ensure you share all of your screen or at least all of the parts you will be
   using as part of the exercise.

3. **Optionally, turn on audio if you want to share your thinking.**  
   This may help give your coach more insight into your thinking and therefore
   give better guidance.

4. **Start recording.**  
   Select 'Record to this computer' if you are prompted whether to record to
   your computer or the cloud.

5. **Do the exercise.**
   It's not a performance and it doesn't need to go perfectly.

6. **Leave the call.**  
   When you leave the call the recording will be processed. You can start a new
   call while you're waiting for that to complete.

7. **Upload the recording.**  
   There will be a link in the materials to the correct form to use.

## What if I'm pairing?

Pairing is an important engineering process and so if you're pairing you should
go ahead, pair on the exercise, and record that. Your coach will then also give
you feedback on your pairing.

When you upload the recording, share both of your names.

## Why videos and not just the code?

In this module we emphasise the value of engineering practices in helping you to
effectively create software. As such, we focus on the practices themselves, not
just the code.

To put it another way — videos include both the code and how you created it.
This allows us to reflect, feed back on, and help you to improve both your code
and your process. If you just shared the code, we would only have half the
story.
